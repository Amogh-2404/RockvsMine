# Rock vs Mine Predictor ðŸª¨ðŸ§¨

Rock vs Mine Predictor is a cool project built using scikit-learn in Python that can predict whether an object detected underwater is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. It's time to embark on a musical journey with rocks and mines!

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered if sonar data could be used to tell apart rocks and mines underwater? Well, wonder no more! This project is all about predicting whether the object detected underwater is a musical rock or an explosive mine. Dive into the depths of machine learning and find out!

## Project Files

This project includes a Python file and a dataset:

1. **main.py**: This is where the magic happens! The Python file contains the code for data collection, data processing, model training, and predictions. It's where the rock vs mine prediction action takes place.

2. **sonar_all-data.csv**: This dataset contains the sonar data used to train and test the prediction model. It's your ticket to understanding the underwater world.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python:  
   `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`
    1. The model will predict whether the object is a rock or a mine based on the provided sonar data.
    2. Enjoy the musical journey of rocks and mines!  
**Note**:- This project is just to provide an intuitive introduction to machine learning which means there is a lot of things that you can (actually should) change and explore the code.
           Right now I have hardcoded the data to be predicted, you can surely change that and test whether the model works are not.
           I encourage you to code this in jupyter notebook or Google Colab and try to understand each and every line.
       

## Contribute Ideas

At the time of building this project, there were no tools for deployment. We've uploaded the main.py file directly. However, we welcome your creative ideas for deploying this project! Feel free to contribute by suggesting deployment strategies and enhancements to the project.
